# Welcome to Madagascar!

Adjusted the 'environment' name to lowercase, in case that was blocking the Sleuth Action from completing.

Testing the new workflow with Sleuth Actions:
- AT-4 in status "Backlog"
- AT-5 in status "In Progress"
- AT-6 in status "Done"

Re-running the last test.

Last test successful. 

Testing the workflow with the added rule to restrict transitions when a condition is not met (field 'Approved' must be filled in):
- AT-1 in status "Done" and "Approved" = "Yes"
- AT-5 in status "Done" and "Approved" = empty

Test again.
